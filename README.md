# Genome & Transcriptome Assembly

This repository contains my work for the Genome and Transcriptome Assembly course.  
It tracks all scripts and workflows used to assemble and analyse the Arabidopsis thaliana genome and transcriptome.

## Structure
- `scripts/` — SLURM job scripts for each analysis step  
- `read_QC/` — Quality control and k-mer counting results  
- `assemblies/` — Genome and transcriptome assemblies  
- `logs/` — SLURM output and error logs  

Raw sequencing data are stored on the cluster at:
/data/courses/assembly-annotation-course/raw_data/
and are not included in this repository.
